Petr's Wardrobe: a website based on image manipulation to create outfits for Petr, UCI's Mascot.
At UCI, Petr sticker culture involves distrubtion of an anteater named Petr wearing different oufits and themes.
We aimed to develop a website that would encourage creation of stickers by making the process accessible to the general public.
